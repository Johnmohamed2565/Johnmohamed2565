TRAFFIC SIGN REGONITION

In this era of Artificial Intelligence, humans are becoming more dependent on
technology. With the enhanced technology, multinational companies like Google,
Tesla, Uber, Ford, Audi, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, and many more are working on
automating vehicles. They are trying to make more accurate autonomous or
driverless vehicles. You all might know about self-driving cars, where the vehicle itself
behaves like a driver and does not need any human guidance to run on the road.
This is not wrong to think about the safety aspects—a chance of significant accidents
from machines. But no machines are more accurate than humans. Researchers are
running many algorithms to ensure 100% road safety and accuracy. One such
algorithm is Traffic Sign Recognition that we talk about in this blog.
● When you go on the road, you see various traffic signs like traffic signals, turn left or
right, speed limits, no passing of heavy vehicles, no entry, children crossing, etc., that
you need to follow for a safe drive. Likewise, autonomous vehicles also have to
interpret these signs and make decisions to achieve accuracy. The methodology of
recognizing which class a traffic sign belongs to is called Traffic signs classification.
● In this Deep Learning project, we will build a model for the classification of traffic
signs available in the image into many categories using a convolutional neural network.

The image dataset is consists of more than 50,000 pictures of various traffic
signs(speed limit, crossing, traffic signals, etc.) Around 43 different classes are
present in the dataset for image classification. The dataset classes vary in size like
some class has very few images while others have a vast number of images. The
dataset doesn’t take much time and space to download as the file size is around
314.36 MB. It contains two separate folders, train and test, where the train folder is
consists of classes, and every category contains various images.
